<h1>Heaviest Element Discovered</h1>
<p>This bit of humor was written in April 1988 and appeared in the January 1989 issue of The Physics Teacher. William DeBuvitz was a physics professor at Middlesex County College in Edison, NJ (USA). He retired in June of 2000.</p>
<p>The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered by investigators at a major U.S. research university. The element, tentatively named <i>Administratium</i>, has no protons or electrons and thus has an atomic number of 0. However, it does have:
  <ul>
    <li>1 neutron</li>
    <li>125 assistant neutrons</li>
    <li>75 vice neutrons</li>
    <li>111 assistant vice neutrons</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>This gives it an atomic mass of 312. These 312 particles are held together by a force that involves the continuous exchange of meson-like particles called morons.</p>
<p>Since it has no electrons, <i>Administratium</i> is inert. However, it can be detected chemically as it impedes every reaction it comes in contact with. According to the discoverers, a minute amount of <i>Administratium</i> causes one reaction to take over four days to complete when it would have normally occurred in less than a second.</p>
<p><i>Administratium</i> has a normal half-life of approximately three years, at which time it does not decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in which assistant neutrons, vice neutrons and assistant vice neutrons exchange places. Some studies have shown that the atomic mass actually increases after a reorganization.</p>
<p>Research at other laboratories indicates that <i>Administratium</i> occurs naturally in the atmosphere. It tends to concentrate at certain points such as government agencies, large corporations, and universities. It can usually be found in the newest, best appointed, and best maintained buildings.</p>
<p>[Further research has found it also in churches and religious institutions.]</p>
<p>Scientists point out that <i>Administratium</i> is known to be toxic at any level of concentration and can easily destroy any productive reaction where it is allowed to accumulate. Attempts are being made to determine how <i>Administratium</i> can be controlled to prevent irreversible damage, but results to date are not promising.</p>
